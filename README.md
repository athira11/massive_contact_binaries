# Suite for models from "Detailed evolutionary models of massive contact binaries: I. Model grids and synthetic populations for the Magellanic Clouds"

# This is the directory of a binary model with the following initial parameters: P= 1.0 day, q= 0.9, M1+M2= Mtotal= 26 Msun. It contains the inlists, src  and make directories that can be edited to suit other close binary massive star parameters as well. 
# Prior to initializing the binary evolution, please create the necessary single star models for your binary model (here they are 12.3M_LMC.mod and 13.7M_LMC.mod). You may find the git repository for the single star models here:
